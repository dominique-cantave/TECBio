# Proto-genetic Algorithm

Created as part of the 2018 TECBio REU Program at the University of Pittsburgh Department of Computational and Systems Biology under the mentorship of Professors Anne-Ruxandra Carvunis and David Koes. The goal of the project was to use a novel model of evolutionary genetics that proposed a mix of genetic drift and positive selection to create new genes from non-genic sequences and integrate this with the classic genetic algorithm. The primary use of the project is to create a hypothetical that summarizes the growth of a network overtime, highlighting important trends and groupings. We modeled it using the performance of stocks in the S&P 500 starting with the earliest recording in [INSERT YEAR] and ending in 01/2018. The project uses the DEAP Evolutionary Algorithm suite as a scaffold and modified the fitness functions and attributes as needed.

The individuals are Jaccard matrices that represent networks containing some subset of the total stocks ever included in the index with edges between nodes indicating a correlation in stock prices from one timestep to the next. Fitness is measured by comparing each network to the actual correlation data for that timestep, creating an evolving fitness landscape. The model behind the Proto-genetic Algorithm proposes that new members to a population (whether stock networks or proteins) are less stable than older members not by chance but as a result of their newness. For the PgA means that all members have an age that increases with each generation, and this age dampens the absolute fitness according to a sigmoid function; after individuals have been in the population for more than THRESH generations, they are stable, and their fitness is evaluated absolutely. This follows the Proto-genetic model because only new genes that have some extremely high level of fitness are able to overcome their instability and remain in the population. The new proto-genes increase the organism's ability to survive in a new environment thus making the system more robust. With stock market data, the individual who has remained in the population the longest should have a reasonably high level of fitness for all stock network timesteps, though perhaps not the maximal fitness for any one generation.
